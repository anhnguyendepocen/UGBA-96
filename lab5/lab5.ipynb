This survey consists of a nationally representative sample of approximately 9,000 youths who were 12 to 16 years old as of December 31, 1996. The survey is longitudinal, meaning the same survey participants are surveyed repeatedly over time. In this case, participants are interviewed once every 1-2 years since 1997. We will study a subset of those survey participants that: (1) went to college; (2) were working for pay in 2013; (3) had parents that reported their income in the original 1997 survey. In total, there are **2327** participants in the data we'll study here.\n",
