The lender offers short-term, high-interest, uncollateralized credit for people without other access to credit. The typical loan is about $150, about a third of the borrower's monthy income. Most of the loans last about four months.\n",

    "Credit Indemnity performed an experiment in which they sent credit offers by mail to more than 50,000 previous customers. In this experiment Credit Indemnity randomly varied the offers in several ways, including the interest rates.

In this case, the interest rate is a percentage of the principal balance that the borrower must pay each month as a fee. For example, consider the four month loan advertised in the letter above, where the interest rate is 3.99. The borrowed amount is 1000 rand (the South African currency). In addition to that initial amount, the borrower pays about 40 ($\\approx 0.0399 \\times 1000$) rand each month in interest.\n",

Customers that the bank perceives have a **high** risk of not repaying their loan face higher interest rates than customers that the bank perceives are **low** risk. But among customers at a given risk level, `offer_rate` can take many values and is **randomly assigned**. Random assignment will allow us to measure the causal relationship between `offer_rate` and loan application rates.\n",
